<h1>Hello, <%= @ta['name'] %>!</h1>

  <%= link_to("View private sign up page", "http://#{BASE_URL}/teaching_assistants/#{@ta['private_id']}") %>

  Or copy this link into your browser:

  <em>This email was sent because you signed up with <a href="http://#{BASE_URL}"><%= CHAPTER_NAME %></a> as a volunteer TA. To remove yourself from the list, visit your private sign up page and mark yourself as inactive.</em>
