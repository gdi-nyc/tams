  If you are unable to make it to any of the dates you’ve committed to,
  %b please let me (not the instructor) know as soon as possible
  so I can try and find a replacement.

%p
  I am here to support you and the instructor for this class, so if there is anything I can do to make it easier or more fun for you, let me know!
